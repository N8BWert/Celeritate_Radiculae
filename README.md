# *Celeritate Radiculae*

*Celeritate Radiculae* (Latin for Speed Radish) is a project aimed at minimizing the time to maturity of radishes.

## Description

### General Description

Up until the 1970s, optimization of the growth of food was mainly focused on selective breeding.  With selective breeding the best and biggest foods were selected to mate, until a satisfactory product has been created.  In the 1970s, selective breeding was put on the backburner and Genetically Modified Organisims (GMOs) entered the forefront of modern commercial agriculture.  While GMOs and selective breeding have produced massive gains in the effectiveness of commercial agriculture, such advancements can only persist for so long before human kind is in need of another revolutionary way to conduct commercial agriculture.

*Celeritate Radiculae* is that solution.  Latin for "speed radish," *Celeritate Radiculae* aims to optimize the growth of the rover radish, *Raphanus sativus*, through the optimization of external factors influencing the growth of such radishes.  

These factors include:
- Ppm of Nutrients (B, Ca, Cl, CO2, Cu, Fe, H, I, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, N, O, P, S, Zn)
- Barometric Pressure of Enclosure
- Percent CO2 and O2 of air
- Humidity
- Light (Active Time, Intensity)
- Temperature
- Activity of the Hydroponic System
- Plant Spacing
- Support Structure
- Amount of Distilled H20 and H20 Replacement Cycle

To account for these variables an enclosure will be created and 3D printed out of PETG plastic in which all of the above factors can be monitored and altered.  Over time a genetic algorithm will optimize the initial conditions of nutrients for the radishes, until a convergence value (or a significant deviation from a 25 day growing period) is obtained.

### Control Variables

To preserve the scientific integrity of this experiment the following factors will be help constant throughout the entire lifecycle of *Celeritate Radiculae*:
- Hydroponic System Activity -> Nutrient Film Technique (NFT)
- Plant Spacing -> 3 inches between plants
- Support Structure -> Unnecessary
- Nutrient Replacement Cycle -> 2 weeks
- Amount of H20 Per Replacement Cycle -> (Unknown)

### Dependent Variables

During the conduction of this experiment the following values will be recorded to preserve scientific integrity:
- Time to Maturity
- Electrical Conductivity of Nutrient Solution

### Independent Variables

The following variables will be altered by the genetic algorithm to optimize the growth of the radish plant:
- Ppm of Boron
- Barometric Pressure
- Ppm of Ca
- Ppm of Cl
- (%) of atmospheric CO2
- Ppm of Cu
- Ppm of Fe
- Ppm of H
- Relative Humidity
- Ppm of I
- Ppm of K
- Light (Active Time)
- Light (Intensity)
- Ppm of Mg
- Ppm of Mn
- Ppm of Mo
- Ppm of N
- Ppm of O
- (%) of atmospheric O2
- PPm of P
- PPm of S
- Temperature
- Ph of Water
- Ppm of Zn

### Goal

The eventual goal of *Celeritate Radiculae* is to lower the time to maturity of radishes by a significant value (optimally 5 days).
